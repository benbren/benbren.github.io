<p>Survival Analysis: the branch of statistics that pretty much everyone I know only associates with biostatistics. I get it - that makes sense. Sure, survival implies.. surviving, but lots of things survive. My attempt to be a vegetarian (still going) is something that â€˜survivesâ€™. Your T.V., your willingness to stay on an email list. Things like that. Survival analysis takes on many different names (for instance, reliability in engineering). Essentially, it deals with data that has â€˜failureâ€™ times and â€˜censoringâ€™ times - so it takes into account actual and observational failure times. For example, a failure time could be death (actual failure) and a censoring time could be a patient lost to follow-up (observational failure). Itâ€™s a cool subject - one that is applicable to almost every field, so letâ€™s dive into some of the basics. The first : <script type="math/tex">T</script>. Big one. The time to event, which is a random variable. The second: <script type="math/tex">C</script>. Also a big one, the time to censoring. And finally, the first and second combined into the third(?): <script type="math/tex">X = min(T,C)</script> which is the event we actually observe. Ok, now actually finally, we have <script type="math/tex">\Delta = I(T \leq C) = I (X = T)</script>, which is just 1 if we observe the event and 0 if we lose the observation to censoring. Those are the big variables for the introduction, so letâ€™s get into talking about the main functions and some examples.</p>

<p>There are 3 main functions in survival analysis, and all can be derived from one another. We have the survival function, the hazard function (or hazard rate, or just hazard) and the cumulative hazard function. Starting with the survival function:</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">S(t) = P(T >t)</script> if t is continuos and <script type="math/tex">S(t _ j)= P(T > t _ j) = P(T \geq t_{j-1} )</script> when t is discrete. How do we define this? We need to define a density first.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f_ T(t) = \lim_{\delta\to 0^+}\frac{1}{\delta}P(t  \leq T \leq t + \delta)</script>

<p>when  $latex T$ is continuous and, simply,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f_T(t) = P(T = t)</script>

<p>when <script type="math/tex">T</script> is discrete. Now, to define our survival function should be relatively easy.</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">S(t) = P(T  > t) = \displaystyle\int_ {t}^{\infty}f_T(u)du</script> when <script type="math/tex">T</script> is continuous</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">S(t) = P(T >t) = \displaystyle\sum_ {n > t}f_T(t)</script> when <script type="math/tex">T</script> is discrete.</p>

<p>A few things to note about a survival function. <script type="math/tex">S(0) = 1</script> as we should not have events happening at time 0. <script type="math/tex">\lim_ {t\to \infty}S(t) = 0</script> as we expect everyone to die or have an event as time goes on. Also, the survival function should be monotone decreasing in <script type="math/tex">t</script>. It is important to note that, in the discrete case, the survival function is right continuous. That is, it has jumps (down) at the values of <script type="math/tex">t</script> where events happen, and is evaluated and the lower probability of survival for those time periods. More formally <script type="math/tex">S(t) = \lim_{x\to t^+}S(x) = S(t^+)</script> This is important when we are estimatingâ€¦ the hazard function! The hazard function is the probability that a person dies at time <script type="math/tex">t</script> GIVEN that they have survived until time <script type="math/tex">t</script>. Let <script type="math/tex">\lambda (t)</script> denote the survival time.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\lambda(t) = \lim_{\delta \to 0^+}\frac{1}{\delta}P(t \leq T \leq t + \delta  \vert T > t)</script>

<p>when <script type="math/tex">T</script> is continuous and</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\lambda(t) = P(T = t \vert T \geq t)</script>

<p>when <script type="math/tex">T</script> is discrete. In general, from the basic probability theory,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(T =t \vert T \geq t) = \frac{P(T = t, T \geq t)}{P(T \geq t)} = \frac{P(T = t)}{P(T \geq t)} = \frac{f_T(t)}{S(t^-)}</script>

<p>Notice that the hazard function, when continuous, is a rate and, when discrete, is a probability. Finally, let us define <script type="math/tex">\Lambda(t)</script> as the cumulative hazard function. It is pretty much exactly what you would think it wasâ€¦</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Lambda(t) = \displaystyle\int_{0}^{t}\lambda(u)du</script>

<p>when continuous and</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Lambda(t) = \displaystyle\sum_{t_i \leq t} \lambda(t_i)</script>

<p>when discrete. Letâ€™s take a look at an interesting problem involving the cumulative hazard function. Say <script type="math/tex">T</script> follows some distribution with cdf <script type="math/tex">F_t(t)</script>. Then its hazard function follows an exponential(1) distribution. To see this</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(\Lambda(T) \leq t) = P( - \Lambda(T)\geq -t ) = P(e^{-\Lambda(T)} \geq e^{-t}) =</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(-e^{-\Lambda(T)} \leq -e^{-t}) = P(1 - e^{-\Lambda(T)} \leq 1 - e^{-t}) =</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(1-S(T) \leq 1- e^{-t}) = P(F_ T(T) \leq 1- e^{-t}) = P(T \leq F_ T^{-1}(1- e^{-t})) = F_ T(F_T^{-1}(1- e^{-t})) = 1- e^{-t}</script>

<p>which is the cdf of the exponential(1) distribution! Cool, huh? Anyways.</p>

<p>It is clear what the link between the hazard function and the cumulative hazard function is, but now let us find the explicit link with the survival function. First (and pretty much only..), remember</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\lambda(t) = \frac{f(t)}{S(t^-)}</script>

<p>When <script type="math/tex">T</script> is continuous, this is equivalent to</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\lambda(t) = \frac{f(t)}{S(t^-)} = \frac{f(t)}{S(t)} = \frac{-d\log S(t)}{dt}</script>

<p>which means</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Lambda(t) = -\log(S(t)</script>

<p>and, equivalently,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">S(t) = e^{-\Lambda(t)}</script>

<p>Nice! Easy. Letâ€™s do an example. Suppose <script type="math/tex">T</script> is such that its survival function is</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">S(t) = \frac{64}{(t+8)^2}</script>

<p>This is continuous. First, a fact:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">E[T] = \displaystyle\int_{0}^{\infty} S(t)dt</script>

<p>How to prove?</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">E[T] = \displaystyle\int_{0}^{\infty} tf(t)dt = \displaystyle\int_{0}^{\infty}\displaystyle\int_{0}^{t}ds f(t)dt = \displaystyle\int_{0}^{\infty}\displaystyle\int_{s}^{\infty}f(t)dtds = \displaystyle\int_{0}^{\infty}1 - F(s) ds  = \displaystyle\int_{0}^{\infty}S(s)ds</script>

<p>So, what is our expected survival time in the above case?</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">E[T] = 64 \displaystyle\int_{0}^{\infty} (t + 8)^{-2} = 64/8 = 8</script>

<p>Median survival time? Clearly, that is just where</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">S(t) = 0.5</script>

<p>so</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{64}{(t_m +8)^2} = 0.5 \implies \sqrt(128) - 8 = t_m = 3.31</script>

<p>Now, letâ€™s estimate the hazard function (and the cumulative hazard).</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Lambda(t) = -\log(S(t)) = 2 \log(t+8) - \log(64)</script>

<p>Now, we just take the derivative with respect to <script type="math/tex">t</script> to find <script type="math/tex">\lambda(t)</script></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\lambda(t) = \frac{2}{t+8}</script>
