<p>Although there are relatively few people visiting my site, I like to give people the opportunity to know about things I care about. Below are a few links to donate to causes that are near and dear to my heart, and I would encourage any and all to donate (or to donate to something that you care deeply about).</p>

<p><a href="https://donate.everytown.org/donate/support-everytown/">Everytown for Gun Safety</a></p>

<p><a href="https://oceana.org/support-oceana">Oceana</a></p>

<p><a href="https://marinemegafaunafoundation.org/support-us/">Marine Megafauna Foundation</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.casaxalteva.org/donate">Casa Xalteva</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/get-involved/other-ways-give">Planned Parenthood</a></p>
