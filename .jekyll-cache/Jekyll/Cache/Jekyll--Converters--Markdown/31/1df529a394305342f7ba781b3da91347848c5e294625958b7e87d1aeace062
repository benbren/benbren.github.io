<p>I was born and raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Some answers to common follow-up questions to that fact:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New Mexico is in the United States.</li>
  <li>Yes, people live in New Mexico.</li>
  <li>No, I have not seen Breaking Bad.</li>
  <li>Yes, I speak Spanish and no, that is not because I am from New Mexico.</li>
</ul>

<p>Half of my undergraduate career was done at the University of New Mexico (Go Lobos!) and my degree is from the College of Charleston in Applied Mathematics and Economics.</p>

<p>I am currently a graduate student in Biostatistics at the University of Michigan, where I have been both a Graduate Student Research Assistant and a Graduate Student Instructor. I am interested in lots of things associated with statistics - machine learning, causal inference, longitudinal data, missing data.. etc. I am also very interested in practical applications such collaborative research and statistical computing. My overarching goal is to use quantitative techniques to improve the lives of other people.</p>

<p>Outside of school, I enjoy snowboarding, rock-climbing, scuba diving, playing guitar, and reading. Pretty typical.  I am also an avid traveler - I love learning about new cultures, ideas and ways of life. To date, I have been to Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Mexico, and Cuba.</p>
