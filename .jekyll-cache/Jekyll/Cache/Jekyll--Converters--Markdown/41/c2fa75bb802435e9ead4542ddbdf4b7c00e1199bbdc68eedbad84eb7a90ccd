I"è<p>Survival Analysis: the branch of statistics that pretty much everyone I know only associates with biostatistics. I get it - that makes sense. Sure, survival implies.. surviving, but lots of things survive. My attempt to be a vegetarian (still going) is something that â€˜survivesâ€™. Your T.V., your willingness to stay on an email list. Things like that. Survival analysis takes on many different names (for instance, reliability in engineering). Essentially, it deals with data that has â€˜failureâ€™ times and â€˜censoringâ€™ times - so it takes into account actual and observational failure times. For example, a failure time could be death (actual failure) and a censoring time could be a patient lost to follow-up (observational failure). Itâ€™s a cool subject - one that is applicable to almost every field, so letâ€™s dive into some of the basics. The first : <script type="math/tex">T</script>. Big one. The time to event, which is a random variable. The second: <script type="math/tex">C</script>. Also a big one, the time to censoring. And finally, the first and second combined into the third(?): <script type="math/tex">X = min(T,C)</script> which is the event we actually observe. Ok, now actually finally, we have <script type="math/tex">\Delta = I(T \leq C) = I (X = T)</script>, which is just 1 if we observe the event and 0 if we lose the observation to censoring. Those are the big variables for the introduction, so letâ€™s get into talking about the main functions and some examples.</p>
