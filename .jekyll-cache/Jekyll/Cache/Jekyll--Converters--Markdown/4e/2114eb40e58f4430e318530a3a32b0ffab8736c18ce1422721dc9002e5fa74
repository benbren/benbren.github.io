<p>Lots of people go through life talking about statistics and not actually knowing what a statistic <em>is</em>, sadly enough. The point of statistics, and statistical inference in general, is to make inferences about a <em>population</em> based off a sample. In general, you have a population parameter (<script type="math/tex">\theta</script>) that needs to be estimated (could be high - dimensional - the most we will talk about is <em>max</em> 2, so no worries) and some data (a random sample, once could say…) <script type="math/tex">X_ 1, \dots, X_ n</script> from that population, from which we observe the data <script type="math/tex">X_ 1, \dots, X_ n</script>. The goal of statistical inference is to take that sample and make really good educated guesses about the population and also make good, educated guesses about how good and educated your guess is. Make sense? I didn’t think so.</p>

<p><strong>Inference</strong> is the process of drawing information about a population based off a sample (like I said above, with a fancy word defining it). The points is - probability theory is based on knowing <script type="math/tex">\theta</script>. We never actually know <script type="math/tex">\theta</script>, so to do anything in practice we need inference about <script type="math/tex">\theta</script>. Big time important.</p>

<p>For example, we know can make conclusions about the probability we get a certain number of successes in a certain number of trials (i.e Binomial(<script type="math/tex">n,p</script>), or the probability that a certain metric is less than some value (i.e <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2</script>)) - but that requires us to know the distribution those values follow in the population (i.e to know the population parameters).</p>

<p>This post will be about a key concept in inference - the <em>sufficient statistic</em>. First - and back to the beginning - what is a statistic?!</p>

<p>A statistics takes data <script type="math/tex">x_1, \dots, x_n = \mathbf{X}</script> and maps it via some function <script type="math/tex">T(.)</script>. That is,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">T(x_1, \dots, x_n) = T(\mathbf{X}): \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m</script>

<p>A few things. $T$ is also a random variable, obviously. There is no restriction on <script type="math/tex">m</script>, but I think you probably get the idea that <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
m < n %]]></script>, because it doesn’t really make sense to make our data more complicated. We also don’t want to lose information in this mapping - this is a key point. For instance, if <script type="math/tex">T(\mathbf{X}) = X_1</script>, we have lost so much information contained in our data by using this transformation.</p>

<p>So, in summary, we want to take our data and use some transformation <script type="math/tex">T(\mathbf{X})</script> to make that data simpler and no less informative. That is what makes a good statistic good. This is why we use some statistics, and not others - as we will see.</p>
