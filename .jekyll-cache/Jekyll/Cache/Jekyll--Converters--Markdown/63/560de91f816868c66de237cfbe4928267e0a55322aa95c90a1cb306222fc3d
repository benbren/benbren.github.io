<p>Let’s say you have some matrix of features (covariates) <script type="math/tex">A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}</script> and a response vector <script type="math/tex">y \in \mathbb{R}^m</script>. We want to find the input vector <script type="math/tex">x \in \mathbb{R}^n</script> that solves this problem or gives us the best possible solution. How should we define best? That is subjective - but the most common idea is to take the real response <script type="math/tex">y_i</script> and the predicted response <script type="math/tex">A[i,:] x</script> and square the difference for each response. We can formalize this problem as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\textrm{argmin} _ x || Ax - y ||_2^2</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\vert\vert . \vert\vert _ 2</script> is the <script type="math/tex">\ell_2</script> norm - where we are just summing the components squared of the input to the norm (in this case, summing predicted minus real squared: the squared error) and taking the square root. We square it just to get rid of the square root - it is the same problem!</p>

<p>Sometimes there may not an exact solution to this problem - that’s why all we are trying to do is minimize this sum of squares. Obviously, if there is an exact solution, that is going to minimize the squared error because, well, there is no error in that case!</p>

<p>When would there be no error? Clearly, this must be the case that <script type="math/tex">y \in \mathcal{R}(A)</script> for there to be no error. That is, the rank of <script type="math/tex">A</script> must be <script type="math/tex">m</script> for there to be no error. Does this guarantee the solution is unique? No. For the solution to be unique, <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{N}(A)</script> must be <script type="math/tex">\phi</script>. That is, the rank of <script type="math/tex">A</script> must be <script type="math/tex">n</script>. Thus, for there to be a unique solution with zero error, <script type="math/tex">A</script> must be square. Notice that a unique solution and a solution with zero error are different concepts. You can have a unique solution where the error is non-zero, and you can have lots (infinite, actually!) solutions that are exact. So, now that we have some intuition into the problem, let’s work on solving it. Let’s think about it geometrically! Let’s consider the 3 <script type="math/tex">\times</script> 3 matrix</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{bmatrix}  1 & 0 & 0 \\  0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \end{bmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>The range of this matrix is the x-y plane, obviously, since its columns span <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}^2</script>. So what if we want to solve a problem of the form</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\textrm{argmin} _ x || Ax - b ||_2^2</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">b \in \mathbb{R}^3</script> and is non-zero in the z-component that is closest to the vector <script type="math/tex">b</script> that exists in the range of our transformation. Check out this figure.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/pics/projection_svd.jpg" alt="Projection" /></p>

<p>The closest point is always the point directly perpendicular (or orthogonal) to the range of <script type="math/tex">A</script> - think about the triangle inequality. Like, if the end of your vector was a donkey, and the range of your matrix was some food that donkeys like (any ideas?), the donkey would walk straight to the food in a direct path. That’s the intuition here. So, in other words, to find the answer to our question, we just need to project the vector we are trying to reach on to the range of values that we can reach. We need a projection matrix <script type="math/tex">P_ {\mathcal{R}(A)}</script>. So, how do we get that…. first, we need to find an (orthonormal) basis for <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{R}(A)</script> and then use that basis to build <script type="math/tex">P_{\mathcal{R}(A)}</script>. So….. how do we get that…</p>

<p>Let’s introduce an easy way to do this - the Singular Value Decomposition. Every matrix, square or not, has an SVD. For positive semi-definite matrices, the SVD is just the same as the Eigendecomposition. (ED). However, unlike the ED, the SVD is defined for rectangular matrices. You can view the ED as kind of a subset of the SVD. Anyways, here’s the definition.</p>
