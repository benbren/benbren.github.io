My name is Ben. 

I was born and raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Half of my undergraduate career was done at the University of New Mexico (Go Lobos!) and my degree is from the College of Charleston in Applied Mathematics and Economics.

I am currently a graduate student in Biostatistics at the University of Michigan, where I have been both a Graduate Student Research Assistant and a Graduate Student Instructor. I am interested in lots of things associated with statistics - machine learning, causal inference, longitudinal data, missing data.. etc. I am also very interested in practical applications such collaborative research and statistical computing. My overarching goal is to use quantitative techniques to improve the lives of other people. 

Outside of school, I enjoy snowboarding, rock-climbing, scuba diving, playing guitar, and reading. Pretty typical.  I am also an avid traveler - I love learning about new cultures, ideas and ways of life.
