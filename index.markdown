My name is Ben. :-)

I was born and raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Some answers to common follow-up questions to that fact:

* New Mexico is in the United States. 
* Yes, people live in New Mexico.  
* No, I have not seen Breaking Bad. 
* Yes, I speak Spanish and no, that is not because I am from New Mexico.
  

Half of my undergraduate career was done at the University of New Mexico (Go Lobos!) and my degree is from the College of Charleston in Applied Mathematics and Economics.

I am currently a PhD student in Biostatistics at the University of Michigan, where I have been both a Graduate Student Research Assistant and a Graduate Student Instructor. I am interested in lots of things associated with statistics - causal inference, environmental statistics, machine learning, longitudinal data, missing data.. etc. I am also very interested in practical applications  such collaborative research and statistical computing. My over-arching goal, in general, is to use quantitative techniques to improve the lives of other people. 

Outside of school, I enjoy snowboarding, playing soccer, rock-climbing, scuba diving, playing guitar, and reading... pretty typical. Importantly, I am a Chelsea fan and a University of Michigan fan. I am also an avid traveler - I love learning about new cultures, ideas and ways of life. To date, I have been to Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Mexico, and Cuba.  

Thanks for looking!
