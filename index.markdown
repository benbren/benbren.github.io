My name is Ben. 

I was born and raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Some answers to common follow-up questions to that fact:

* New Mexico is in the United States. 
* Yes, people live in New Mexico.  
* No, I have not seen Breaking Bad. 
* Yes, I (kind of..) speak Spanish and no, that is not because I am from New Mexico.
  

Half of my undergraduate career was done at the University of New Mexico (Go Lobos!) and my degree is from the College of Charleston in Applied Mathematics and Economics.

I am currently a graduate student in Biostatistics at the University of Michigan, where I have been both a Graduate Student Research Assistant and a Graduate Student Instructor. My research is broadly based on modeling sparse systems using continuous shrinkage priors with applications to brain imaging. I am very interested in practical applications regarding mental health and substance abuse disorders. My over-arching goal, in general, is to use quantitative techniques to improve the lives of other people.  

Outside of school, I enjoy running, playing soccer, rock-climbing, scuba diving, playing guitar, and reading. Importantly, I am a Chelsea fan and a University of Michigan fan. I am also an avid traveler - I love learning about new cultures, ideas and ways of life. To date, I have been to Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Mexico, and Cuba. Most importantly, I have a little 10 year old rescue dog named Dodger who has too many nicknames to count. 

I am using this site mostly to share blog posts about material that interests me and material that I find useful to explain in order for myself and my friends to understand better. In the future, I hope to use this as an academic website to host my work and other parts of my life.

Thanks for looking!
